This is a collection of basic libraries.
* All are written in POSIX C, aim to used compatibility on x86, arm, android, ios.
* Each of library is independent project, only include the needed library to your project instead of the whole libraries
* Aim to reuse for embedded and network service development

## How To Build
Recommend Ubuntu14.04 gcc-4.8.4+
  * linux platform (32/64 bit)  
   `$ cd libraries`  
   `$ ./build.sh`  
   `$ sudo ./build.sh install`

  * host(linux) target(rasberrypi)  
    (you need download [toolchain of rasberrypi](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git))  
   `$ ./build.sh all pi`

  * host(rasberrypi board)  
   `$ ./build.sh`  
   `$ sudo ./build.sh install`  

  * android arm cross compile  
   (you need download [android-ndk-r9-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r9-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2))  
   `$ ./build.sh all android`  

  * android naitve develop  
    also need ndk tools  
   `$ cd android_jni_libs`  
   `$ ndk-build`  

   After install, the libxxx.xx will be installed in /usr/local/lib/.  
   libxxx.h, libxxx.so or libxxx.a of libraries are also in ./output/$(ARCH)  

## How To Autogen C code
   If you want to add your own library into the build script, no need repeat the same code, only auto gen libxxx framework.  
  `$ ./autogen_lib.sh libfoo`

## About Build
  * by default, build x86 on linux, and libxxx folder can be built independently
  * if only "libxxx folder" is checkout without "build folder", you can only build x86 and no color set
  * with "build folder", you can build x86, pi, android, ios and color is also set
  * "sudo make install" is needed when build libxxx alone.
